# Solving Trivia Table View Lab
This lab is designed to be solved through guided instruction and group programming. The final product should display all 50 states and check each state against its capital to identify shared letters between the names.
## Instructions
1. Create a struct with a property called `statesAndCapitals` that contains key-value pairs of all states and their respective capitals.
2. Create a `tableViewController` that displays all 50 states in alphabetical order.
3. Add functionality such that tapping on a state name in the `tableViewController` displays a `UIAlertViewController` with the name of the state, its respective capital, and whether the two have any shared letters or are entirely unique.
