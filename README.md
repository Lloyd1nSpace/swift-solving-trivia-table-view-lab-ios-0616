#Solving Trivia Table View Lab

1. Create a `Location` struct with a property called `statesAndCapitals` that contains key-value pairs of all states and their respective capitals.
2. Create a `tableViewController` that displays all 50 states.
3. Add functionality to allow tapping on a state name in the `tableViewController` to display whether the state and its respective capital share any common letters in their names.
